This is a collection of notes that I frequently reference when providing information in the Facebook group for UFT members. It's also an opportunity to practice using git and the terminal.

* Salary Upgrades

From HR Connect article 9783:
Rejected salary differential applications preserve your submission date as long as you submitted the requested documentation. Declined applications kick you back to the start of the queue with a new submission date.

If the application that was approved (or rejected and revised) was submitted by December 31st, 2023, you'll get backpay to July 1st, 2023.

If the application was submitted after December 31st, 2023 your effective date should be the first day of the month following the date you submitted the completed application (July 2024); you will not be eligible for retroactive pay before that date.
